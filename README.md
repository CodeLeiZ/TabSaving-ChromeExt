# URL Bookmarking Tool

This project is a simple **URL bookmarking tool** that allows users to save their favorite links and quickly access them later. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the tool offers a smooth and interactive experience. Users can add URLs via an input field or directly from the current active tab in their browser. All links are stored in the browserâ€™s **localStorage**, ensuring that they persist across sessions.

## Key Features

- **Save URLs**: Add URLs through an input field or directly from the active browser tab.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saved URLs are stored in **localStorage**, so they are available even after a browser refresh.
- **Clear All Links**: Easily delete all saved URLs with a double-click on the delete button.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press **Enter** to save the URL in the input field, improving usability.
- **Easy Access**: Click on saved URLs to quickly open them in a new tab.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users can enter a URL manually or grab the current tab's URL with the "Save Tab" button.
2. **Storage**: URLs are stored in **localStorage**, and the list of saved links is rendered dynamically on the page.
3. **Rendering**: The list of saved URLs is displayed as clickable links, allowing users to open them in a new tab.
4. **Delete Function**: Double-click the "Delete All" button to clear all saved links.

This tool provides a simple yet effective way to manage and access your favorite websites directly from the browser!

## How to Use

1. **Enter a URL** in the input field or use the **Save Tab** button to automatically grab the URL of the current active tab.
2. **Press Enter** or click the **Save** button to save the link.
3. **Access saved links** by clicking on them in the list.
4. **Double-click** the **Delete All** button to clear the saved links.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles all logic for saving, retrieving, and displaying URLs.
- **HTML/CSS**: Simple structure and styling for the user interface.
- **localStorage**: Ensures that the saved links persist even when the browser is closed and reopened.

This project was part of my journey through the **Scrimba JavaScript Course**.
